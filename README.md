##Dank Assistive Netlisting Kit

This build tool which is made using the waf meta build framework (waf.io), encapsulates my gEDA/lepton build flow for schematic capture and netlisting.


> See section "4.2.2. Loading and using Waf tools" in waf.io/book

### TODO : 
replace 'sed' with 'sedpy' : https://github.com/mritunjaysharma394/sedpy

Also see gSim for pre/post processing of schematics and netlists (https://github.com/pfabo/gSim)
